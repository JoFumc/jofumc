The "multibar" page template generates the common header and footer areas,
as well as the site-common sidebar.  It also splits the workarea
into an application area and a multibar (other sidebar).
The page fragment will be inserted
into the application (usually between the sidebars).
Pages defined here will have a common sidebar and
a common secondary sidebar.
